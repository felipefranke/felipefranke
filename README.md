# Biography

Hello! My name is Felipe Franke and I am a technology and education enthusiast. I have a degree in graphic design and a master's and PhD in Political Sociology. Additionally, I have a postgraduate degree in Content designer for e-learning.

Currently, I am focused on studying programming because I believe in the importance of mastering this field to drive the development of new educational technologies, a field in which I have been working for over 10 years. I have intermediate knowledge in HTML and CSS, and I am just starting to delve into JavaScript, PHP, and C#

This repository serves as a way to share my learning journey and programming-related projects. Here, you will find different projects and exercises that I am working on to enhance my skills.
